Each has a\n * `_$parent` reference which is set during construction in the core code, and a\n * `_$disconnectableChildren` field which is initially undefined.\n *\n * The sparse tree created by means of the `AsyncDirective` constructor\n * crawling up the `_$parent` tree and placing a `_$disconnectableChildren` Set\n * on each parent that includes each child that contains a\n * `AsyncDirective` directly or transitively via its children. In order to\n * notify connection state changes and disconnect (or reconnect) a tree, the\n * `_$notifyConnectionChanged` API is patched onto ChildParts as a directive\n * climbs the parent tree, which is called by the core when clearing a part if\n * it exists.

The\n * ChildPart will _clear() itself, and so we need to disconnect the \"value\" of\n * the ChildPart (but not its directive). In this case, when `_clear()` calls\n * `_$notifyConnectionChanged()`, we don't iterate all of the\n * _$disconnectableChildren, rather we do a value-specific disconnection: i.e.\n * since the _value was an Array<ChildPart> (because an iterable had been\n * committed), we iterate the array of ChildParts (N14, N16) and run\n * `setConnected` on them (which does recurse down the full tree of\n * `_$disconnectableChildren` below it, and also removes N14 and N16 from N12's\n * `_$disconnectableChildren`). Once the values have been disconnected, we then\n * check whether the ChildPart(N12)'s list of `_$disconnectableChildren` is empty\n * (and would remove it from its parent TemplateInstance(T3) if so), but since\n * it would still contain its directive D13, it stays in the disconnectable\n * tree.\n *\n * Example 2: In the course of Example 1, `setConnected` will reach\n * ChildPart(N16); in this case the entire part is being disconnected, so we\n * simply iterate all of N16's `_$disconnectableChildren` (D17,T18) and\n * recursively run `setConnected` on them. Note that we only remove children\n * from `_$disconnectableChildren` for the top-level values being disconnected\n * on a clear; doing this bookkeeping lower in the tree is wasteful since it's\n * all being thrown away.\n *\n * Example 3: If the LitElement containing the entire tree above becomes\n * disconnected, it will run `childPart.setConnected()` (which calls\n * `childPart._$notifyConnectionChanged()` if it exists); in this case, we\n * recursively run `setConnected()` over the entire tree, without removing any\n * children from `_$disconnectableChildren`, since this tree is required to\n * re-connect the tree, which does the same operation, simply passing\n * `isConnectd: true` down the tree, signaling which callback to run.\n */\n\nimport {AttributePart, ChildPart, Disconnectable, Part} from './lit-html.js';\nimport {isSingleExpression} from './directive-helpers.js';\nimport {Directive, PartInfo, PartType} from './directive.js';\nexport {directive} from './directive.js';\n\nconst DEV_MODE = true;\n\n/**\n * Recursively walks down the tree of Parts/TemplateInstances/Directives to set\n * the connected state of directives and run `disconnected`/ `reconnected`\n * callbacks.\n *\n * @return True if there were children to disconnect; false otherwise\n */\nconst notifyChildrenConnectedChanged = (\n  parent: Disconnectable,\n  isConnected: boolean\n): boolean => {\n  const children = parent._$disconnectableChildren;\n  if (children === undefined) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  for (const obj of children) {\n    // The existence of `_$notifyDirectiveConnectionChanged` is used as a \"brand\" to\n    // disambiguate AsyncDirectives from other DisconnectableChildren\n    // (as opposed to using an instanceof check to know when to call it); the\n    // redundancy of \"Directive\" in the API name is to avoid conflicting with\n    // `_$notifyConnectionChanged`, which exists `ChildParts` which are also in\n    // this list\n    // Disconnect Directive (and any nested directives contained within)\n    // This property needs to remain unminified.\n    (obj as AsyncDirective)['_$notifyDirectiveConnectionChanged']?.(\n      isConnected,\n      false\n    );\n    // Disconnect Part/TemplateInstance\n    notifyChildrenConnectedChanged(obj, isConnected);\n  }\n  return true;\n};\n\n/**\n * Removes the given child from its parent list of disconnectable children, and\n * if the parent list becomes empty as a result, removes the parent from its\n * parent, and so forth up the tree when that causes subsequent parent lists to\n * become empty.\n */\nconst removeDisconnectableFromParent = (obj: Disconnectable) => {\n  let parent, children;\n  do {\n    if ((parent = obj._$parent) === undefined) {\n      break;\n    }\n    children = parent._$disconnectableChildren!;\n    children.delete(obj);\n    obj = parent;\n  } while (children?.size === 0);\n};\n\nconst addDisconnectableToParent = (obj: Disconnectable) => {\n  // Climb the parent tree, creating a sparse tree of children needing\n  // disconnection\n  for (let parent; (parent = obj._$parent); obj = parent) {\n    let children = parent._$disconnectableChildren;\n    if (children === undefined) {\n      parent._$disconnectableChildren = children = new Set();\n    } else if (children.has(obj)) {\n      // Once we've reached a parent that already contains this child, we\n      // can short-circuit\n      break;\n    }\n    children.add(obj);\n    installDisconnectAPI(parent);\n  }\n};\n\n/**\n * Changes the parent reference of the ChildPart, and updates the sparse tree of\n * Disconnectable children accordingly.\n *\n * Note, this method will be patched onto ChildPart instances and called from\n * the core code when parts are moved between different parents.\n */\nfunction reparentDisconnectables(this: ChildPart, newParent: Disconnectable) {\n  if (this._$disconnectableChildren !== undefined) {\n    removeDisconnectableFromParent(this);\n    this._$parent = newParent;\n    addDisconnectableToParent(this);\n  } else {\n    this._$parent = newParent;\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Sets the connected state on any directives contained within the committed\n * value of this part (i.e. within a TemplateInstance or iterable of\n * ChildParts) and runs their `disconnected`/`reconnected`s, as well as within\n * any directives stored on the ChildPart (when `valueOnly` is false).\n *\n * `isClearingValue` should be passed as `true` on a top-level part that is\n * clearing itself, and not as a result of recursively disconnecting directives\n * as part of a `clear` operation higher up the tree.
