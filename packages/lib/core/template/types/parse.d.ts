/**
 * Breaks up the given `template` string into a tree of tokens. If the `tags`
 * argument is given here it must be an array with two string values: the
 * opening and closing tags used in the template (e.g. [ "<%", "%>" ]). Of
 * course, the default is to use mustaches (i.e. mustache.tags).
 *
 * A token is an array with at least 4 elements. The first element is the
 * mustache symbol that was used inside the tag, e.g. "#" or "&". If the tag
 * did not contain a symbol (i.e. {{myValue}}) this element is "name". For
 * all text that appears outside a symbol this element is "text".
 *
 * The second element of a token is its "value". For mustache tags this is
 * whatever else was inside the tag besides the opening symbol. For text tokens
 * this is the text itself.
 *
 * The third and fourth elements of the token are the start and end indices,
 * respectively, of the token in the original template.
 *
 * Tokens that are the root node of a subtree contain two more elements: 1) an
 * array of tokens in the subtree and 2) the index in the original template at
 * which the closing tag for that section begins.
 *
 * Tokens for partials also contain two more elements: 1) a string value of
 * indendation prior to that tag and 2) the index of that tag on that line -
 * eg a value of 2 indicates the partial is the third tag on this line.
 *
 * @param template template string
 * @param tags delimiters ex) ['{{','}}'] or '{{ }}'
